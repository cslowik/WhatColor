# WhatColor
A little menu bar app that shows the current time as a color.

Inspired by: http://whatcolourisit.scn9a.org

I make colors a bit differently. The raw numbers are turned into ratios and used for each color, rather than using the numbers themselves. This gets the colors out of the dark greens and blues, and should give for some nice variety through the day!

Hours: red

Minutes: green

Seconds: blue
